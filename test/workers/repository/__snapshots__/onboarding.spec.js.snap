This is an onboarding PR to help you understand and configure Renovate before any changes are made to any \`package.json\` files. Once you close this Pull Request, Renovate will begin keeping your dependencies up-to-date via automated Pull Requests.

With your current configuration, renovate will initially create the following Pull Requests:

| Pull Requests (2) |
| ------ |
| **Pin a**<ul><li>Branch name: \`branch-a\`</li><li>Pins [a](https://a) in \`undefined\` from \`^1.0.0\` to \`1.1.0\`</li></ul> |
| **Upgrade b**<ul><li>Schedule: \\"on monday\\"</li><li>Branch name: \`branch-b\`</li><li>Upgrades [b](https://b) in \`undefined\` from \`1.0.0\` to \`2.0.0\`</li></ul> |


Sometimes you may see multiple options for the same dependency (e.g. pinning in one branch and upgrading in another). This is expected and allows you the flexibility to choose which to merge first. Once you merge any PR, others will be updated or removed the next time Renovate runs.

Would you like to change the way Renovate is upgrading your dependencies? Simply edit the \`renovate.json\` in this branch and this Pull Request description will be updated the next time Renovate runs.

The [Configuration](https://github.com/singapore/renovate/blob/master/docs/configuration.md) and [Configuration FAQ](https://github.com/singapore/renovate/blob/master/docs/faq.md) documents should be helpful if you wish to modify any behaviour.

#### Don't want a \`renovate.json\` file?

You are not required to *merge* this Pull Request - Renovate will begin even if this \\"Configure Renovate\\" PR is closed *unmerged* and without a \`renovate.json\` file. However, it's recommended that you add configuration to your repository to ensure behaviour matches what you see described here.

Alternatively, you can add the same configuration settings into a \\"renovate\\" section of your \`package.json\` file(s) in this branch and delete the \`renovate.json\` from this PR. If you make these configuration changes in this branch then the results will be described in this PR after the next time Renovate runs.

You have configured renovate to use branch \`next\` as base branch.

It looks like your repository dependencies are already up-to-date and no initial Pull Requests will be necessary.
