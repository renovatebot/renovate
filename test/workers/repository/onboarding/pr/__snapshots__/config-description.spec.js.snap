## Configuration Summary

Based on the currently configured presets, Renovate will:

  - Start dependency updates only once this Configure Renovate PR is merged
  - Run Renovate on following schedule: before 5am

Would you like to change the way Renovate is upgrading your dependencies? Simply edit the \`renovate.json\` in this branch and this Pull Request description will be updated the next time Renovate runs. Try to use Config Presets (the \`extends\` array) when possible rather than raw config, as then this PR will be able to more accurately describe your settings.
