# Docs site

The [Renovate docs site](https://docs.renovatebot.com) is built from [a dedicated publishing repository](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovatebot.github.io) that pulls the source files from [this repository](../usage/).

The publishing process is triggered automatically via Renovate updates.
If you have submitted a documentation PR and your changes are not published within a day feel free to ping the maintainers.
