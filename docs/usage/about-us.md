## About these docs

The Renovate docs are built from Markdown files in our [`renovatebot/renovate` repository](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate).
Most of the source files can be found in the [`docs/usage/` directory](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/tree/main/docs/usage).

We use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to build our docs.
