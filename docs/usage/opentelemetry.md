# OpenTelemetry and Renovate

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! warning "This feature is flagged as experimental"
    Experimental features might be changed or even removed at any time.

Renovate supports OpenTelemetry which is an emerging monitoring standard.

OpenTelemetry supports three types of observability data:

- traces
- metrics
- logs

Renovate can only send traces and only via the OpenTelemetryProtocol (OTLP), other observability data or transfer protocols are not supported.

## Usage

To activate the instrumentation, the environment variable `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` has to be set.
This sets the endpoint where to send the telemetry data.
If this endpoint is set, all other environment variables defined by the [OpenTelemetry specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/sdk-environment-variables.md) are supported.

For debugging purposes the telemetry can also be printed to the console if the environment variable `RENOVATE_TRACING_CONSOLE_EXPORTER` is set.

## Examples

An usage example with a local OpenTelemetry setup can be found in the [OpenTelemetry examples](examples/opentelemetry.md)
