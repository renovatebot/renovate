# Logo and brand guidelines

This page explains how you may use the Renovate name, logo and branding.

## Do not pretend to be the real Renovate app

Avoid using our name, logo, or branding in a way that causes people to think you are the real Renovate app on a public platform.
For example: do _not_ call your self-hosted version something like @realrenovatebot on GitHub.

## Do not pretend to be a Renovate developer

Avoid using our name, logo, or branding in a way that causes people to think you are a developer of Renovate.

## Allowed uses of the Renovate logo

You are allowed to use our logo as:

- an icon in your repository readme, that says you're using Renovate
- part of a badge in your repository readme, that says you're using Renovate
- an avatar image for your self-hosted version of Renovate, but give your bot a _different_ name

## Allowed uses of the Renovate name

You are allowed to use the Renovate name:

- to refer to the official Renovate app
- in contexts where it's clear you are referring to your self-hosted version

## We keep the rights to our logo, name, and branding
