# Python package manager support

Renovate supports several Python package managers, including `pip`, `pipenv`, `poetry`, etc.
See [all supported managers](https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/).

## Versioning support

We've written a JavaScript version of the [PEP440 specification](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/) so we can use it in Renovate bot.
You can find this project in our [`renovatebot/pep440` repository](https://github.com/renovatebot/pep440).

Our PEP440 implementation supports pinned versions and ranges.
Legacy versions with the `===` prefix are ignored.

## How it works

1. Renovate searches through each repository for package files
1. Existing dependencies are extracted from the package files
1. Renovate searches for the latest version on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) to decide if there are upgrades
1. If the source package includes a GitHub URL as its source, and has a "changelog" file _or_ uses GitHub releases, a Release Note will be embedded in the generated PR

## Alternative file names

For the `pip_requirements` manager, the default file matching regex for `requirements.txt` follows common file name conventions.
But Renovate may not find all your files.

You can tell Renovate where to find your file(s) by setting your own `fileMatch` regex:

```json
{
  "pip_requirements": {
    "fileMatch": ["my/specifically-named.file", "\\.requirements$"]
  }
}
```

## Alternate registries

By default Renovate checks for upgrades on the `pypi.org` registry.

If you want, you can set alternative index URLs.
There are three ways to do this:

- index-url in `requirements.txt`
- sources in `Pipfile`
- sources in `pyproject.toml`
- set URL in Renovate configuration

### index-url in `requirements.txt`

You can set the index URL in the first line of the `requirements.txt`, for example:

```
--index-url http://example.com/private-pypi/
some-package==0.3.1
some-other-package==1.0.0
```

### Sources in `Pipfile`

Renovate finds and uses any custom sources in your `Pipfile`.

### Sources in `pyproject.toml`

Renovate detects any custom-configured sources in `pyproject.toml` and uses them.

### Specify URL in configuration

Create a `python` object and put a `registryUrls` array in it.
Fill the array with alternate index URL(s).

```json
{
  "python": {
    "registryUrls": ["http://example.com/private-pypi/"]
  }
}
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! tip
    If a `requirements.txt` file has an index-url then Renovate follows that link, instead of following any link set in the `registryUrls` array.
    To override the URL found in `requirements.txt`, you must create a custom `packageRules` setting.
    This is because `packageRules` are applied _after_ package file extraction.

## Disabling Python support

To disable all managers with `language` set to `python` in Renovate, do this:

```json
{
  "python": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can use `enabledManagers` to tell Renovate what package managers it can use.
For example, if you only want to use Renovate's `npm` package manager:

```json
{
  "enabledManagers": ["npm"]
}
```
