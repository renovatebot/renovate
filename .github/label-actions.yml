    To get started, please read our guide on creating a [minimal reproduction](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/main/docs/development/minimal-reproductions.md).


    We may close the issue if you, or someone else, haven't created a minimal reproduction within two weeks.

    Hi there,


    You're asking us to support a new package manager.

    Please copy/paste [the new package manager questionnaire](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/main/docs/development/new-package-manager-template.md), and fill it out in full.


    Once the questionnaire is filled out we'll decide if we want to support this new manager.

'pr:no-coverage-ignore':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    You're skipping code tests with `istanbul ignore`.


    Please only skip tests if:
      - you cannot test the code, or
      - the code is very difficult to test, or
      - the edge case won't usually happen at runtime


    If you skip a test, always comment why:


    ```ts
    // istanbul ignore next: typescript strict null check
    if (!url) {
      return null;
    }
    ```


    Good luck,


    The Renovate team

    Please read our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/main/.github/contributing.md#resolve-review-comments-instead-of-commenting) to reduce noise.
