    Hi there,


    The Renovate team needs your help!
    Before we can start work on your issue we first need to know exactly what's causing the current behavior.
    A minimal reproduction helps us with this.


    To get started, please read our guide on [minimal reproductions](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/master/docs/development/minimal-reproductions.md) to understand what is needed.


    We may close the issue if you have not provided a minimal reproduction within two weeks.
    If you need more time, or are stuck, please ask for help or more time in a comment.


    Good luck,


    The Renovate team

    Hi there,


    We have found that there's a problem with the logs.
    Depending on which situation applies follow one, some or all of these instructions.


    ### No logs at all

    If there's no log posted yet, we need you to find and copy/paste the log into the issue template.


    #### Finding logs on hosted app

    <details><summary>Click me to read instructions</summary>


    If you use the Renovate app (GitHub):

    1. Go to the affected PR, and search for "View repository job log here"

    1. Click on the link to go to the "WhiteSource Renovate Dashboard" and log in

    1. You are now in the correct repository log overview screen

    1. Copy/paste the correct log

    1. Follow the steps in the **formatting your logs** section

    </details>


    #### Finding logs when self-hosting

    <details><summary>Click me to read instructions</summary>


    If you're running self-hosted, run with `LOG_LEVEL=debug` in your environment variables and search for whatever dependency/branch/PR that is causing the problem.

    </details>


    ### Insufficient logs

    If you already provided logs, and the Renovate team said they are not enough, follow the instructions from the **No logs at all** section.

    ### Formatting your logs

    Please put your logs in a `<details>` and `<summary>` element like this:
