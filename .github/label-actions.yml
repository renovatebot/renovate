    Hi there,


    The Renovate team needs your help!
    To fix the problem, we first need to know exactly what's causing the bug.
    A minimal reproduction help us to pinpoint the exact cause of the bug.


    To get started, please read our guide on [minimal reproductions](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/main/docs/development/minimal-reproductions.md) to understand what is needed.


    We may close the issue if you have not provided a minimal reproduction within two weeks.
    If you need more time, or are stuck, please ask for help or more time in a comment.


    Good luck,


    The Renovate team
