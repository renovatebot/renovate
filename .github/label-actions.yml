    Hi there,


    Get your discussion fixed faster by creating a minimal reproduction.
    This means a repository dedicated to reproducing this issue with the minimal dependencies and config possible.


    Before we start working on your issue we need to know exactly what's causing the current behavior.
    A minimal reproduction helps us with this.
    Discussions without reproductions are less likely to be converted to Issues.


    To get started, please read our guide on creating a [minimal reproduction](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/main/docs/development/minimal-reproductions.md).


    Good luck,


    The Renovate team

    Hi there,


    You're asking us to support a new package manager.
    We need to know some basic information about this package manager first.
    Please copy/paste [the new package manager questionnaire](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/main/docs/development/new-package-manager-template.md), and fill it out in full.


    Once the questionnaire is filled out we'll decide if we want to support this new manager.

'auto:retry-latest':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    You're reporting a problem with an old version of Renovate.

'auto:no-coverage-ignore':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    You're skipping code tests with `istanbul ignore`.


    Please only skip tests if:
     - you cannot test the code, or
     - the code is very difficult to test, or
     - the edge case won't usually happen at runtime


    If you skip a test, always comment why:


    ```ts
    // istanbul ignore next: typescript strict null check
    if (!url) {
      return null;
    }
    ```


    Good luck,


    The Renovate team

    Hi there,


    You are using `done` comments which cause a lot of noise/notifications.

    Good luck,

    **Please create a GitHub Discussion before continuing with this PR.**


    Thank you for your PR, but we need to discuss the requirements and implementation first.

'auto:discussion-closed':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    We're closing this discussion because it's missing some details, or because something else about it made it hard or impossible for us to help resolve the issue.


    We want high quality discussions, so users can search them for answers.
    This means we'll close (and later delete) low quality discussions.


    You are welcome to create a new discussion with more details in future.


    Thanks, the Renovate team.

'auto:bad-vibes':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    A maintainer has flagged this discussion as giving off some bad vibes. **Maintainers will no longer participate in this discussion unless/until such "vibes" are resolved.**


    This is typically when someone is overly critical of the product or the assistance they're receiving.
    Or being unreasonably demanding or lazy, such as refusing to provide logs, or other information, when asked.


    Open Source means you're welcome to use the software with few limits applied.
    But you should _not_ give maintainers a bad day or contribute to Open Source burnout.


    If you feel this message is wrong or due to a misunderstanding, please let us know. If you see this message but don't take it as a sign to cool off or back off, we may close the discussion and block you from the repository.


    If you want to get the discussion back on track, we would like you to:
     - Remove, or edit, the bad vibes parts of your comments
     - Say that you understand the problem (we don't need a lengthy apology)
     - Stop giving off more bad vibes


    Thanks, the Renovate team

'auto:one-topic':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    Please stick to one topic/question per Discussion. Start a new discussion per topic.


    This prevents future users from finding this discussion and getting confused by multiple questions and answers. One question and answer per Discussion works best.


    For example:
     - Don't create a discussion with multiple questions requiring multiple answers
     - If you got an answer to your first question, don't change topic like "Can I also ask you how I might..." which would then require a different answer. Mark the current discussion as answered and open a new one.


    Thanks, the Renovate team

'auto:no-mentions':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    This is intended as a polite, automated _request_ that users avoid `@` mentioning repository maintainers like `@rarkins` or `@viceice`. Doing so causes annoying mobile notifications and makes it harder to maintain this repository.


    We know it might be common elsewhere but we participate in hundreds of discussions a week and would need to turn off GitHub mobile notifications if we were mentioned in every one.


    As a general rule, we will read and respond to all discussions in this repository, so there is no need to mention us.


    Thanks, the Renovate team
