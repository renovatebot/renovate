    Hi there,

    The Renovate team needs your help!
    To fix the problem, we first need to know exactly what's causing the bug.
    A minimal reproduction help us to pinpoint the exact cause of the bug.

    To get started, please read our guide on [minimal reproductions](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/master/docs/development/minimal-reproductions.md) to understand what is needed.

    We may close the issue if you have not provided a minimal reproduction within two weeks.
    If you need more time, or are stuck, please ask for help or more time in a comment.

    Good luck,

    The Renovate team

    Thank you for providing a reproduction! :tada: :rocket:

    The Renovate team will take a look at the reproduction repository.
    Once we confirm the provided repository reproduces the problem, the label will be changed to `reproduction:confirmed`.

'status:requirements':
  comment: >
    This issue has been labeled with `status:requirements`. This indicates that we don't know enough to start work and further requirements or a reproduction are needed first.

    This label will be replaced with `status:ready` once all requirements and reproductions necessary to start work have been met.

    If it's not clear _what_ is missing to move this issue forward, ask for clarifacation in a new comment.
    If you think we already have what we need to move forward, mention this in a new comment.
