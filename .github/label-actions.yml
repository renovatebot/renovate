'auto:reproduction':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    Get your discussion fixed faster by creating a minimal reproduction.
    This means a repository dedicated to reproducing this issue with the minimal dependencies and config possible.


    Before we start working on your issue we need to know exactly what's causing the current behavior.
    A minimal reproduction helps us with this.
    Discussions without reproductions are less likely to be converted to Issues.


    Please follow these steps:
     1. Read our guide on creating a [minimal reproduction](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/main/docs/development/minimal-reproductions.md).
     2. Go to our [minimal reproduction template repository](https://github.com/renovatebot/minimal-reproduction-template).
     3. Select the _Use this template_ button to create a new repository based on the template.
     4. Work on the minimal reproduction in your own repository.
     5. Fill out the information in your repository's `README.md`.
     6. Add the link to your reproduction to the first post of your Discussion. If you are not the original author, you can post a new comment with the link.

    If you need help with running renovate on your minimal reproduction repository, please refer to our [Running Renovate guide](https://docs.renovatebot.com/getting-started/running/).

    Good luck,


    The Renovate team

    Hi there,


    This issue or discussion is missing some logs, making it difficult or impossible to help you.
    Depending on which situation applies follow one, some or all of these instructions.


    ### No logs at all

    If you haven't posted any log yet, we need you to find and copy/paste the log into the issue template.


    #### Finding logs on hosted app

    Hi there,


    A maintainer wants you to find and share a specific log message (`packageFiles with updates`) from your repository or environment.


    If you self-host Renovate: make sure you run Renovate with `LOG_LEVEL=debug` to get the debug log messages! Next, open the debug-level logs and search for `packageFiles with updates`. This text marks the start of a structured log message that shows every package file, dependency, and update that Renovate found.


    Find the relevant dependency/dependencies in the log message, and copy/paste those parts into this discussion. If you do not know which bits we need, you can copy/paste the full log message.


    Read the [Renovate docs, Troubleshooting](https://docs.renovatebot.com/troubleshooting/) to learn more about getting the docs, and getting the correct type of logs.


    Thanks, the Renovate team

'auto:logs-reduction':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    Please limit the amount of logs you're pasting into this discussion. The maintainers have a limited amount of time to help you, and often do so from mobile devices. It's easier for us if you only paste the relevant parts of the logs, and point us to the lines you think are relevant.


    For example, if your problem is about a certain dependency, find the log sections which apply to that dependency and paste only those sections. Similarly, if your problem is about a particular branch/PR, find the log sections which apply to that branch/PR and paste only those sections.


    If you're not sure, it's acceptable to paste the full logs, including into a gist. Please try to explain the problem in enough detail to give us starting points to debug. If you only paste the full log, and do nothing else, it is likely that we will take longer to help you, or we may not start to help you at all.


    Thanks, the Renovate team

'new package manager':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    You're asking us to support a new package manager.
    We need to know some basic information about this package manager first.
    Please copy/paste [the new package manager questionnaire](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/main/docs/development/new-package-manager-template.md), and fill it out in full.


    Once the questionnaire is filled out we'll decide if we want to support this new manager.


    Good luck,


    The Renovate team

'auto:retry-latest':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    You're reporting a problem with an old version of Renovate.
    Please try the latest version and tell us if that fixes your problem.


    Be sure to provide updated logs once you have run with a newer version.


    Good luck,


    The Renovate team

'auto:no-coverage-ignore':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    You're skipping code tests with `istanbul ignore`.


    Please only skip tests if:
     - you cannot test the code, or
     - the code is very difficult to test, or
     - the edge case won't usually happen at runtime


    If you skip a test, always comment why:


    ```ts
    // istanbul ignore next: typescript strict null check
    if (!url) {
      return null;
    }
    ```


    Good luck,


    The Renovate team

'auto:no-done-comments':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    You are using `done` comments which cause a lot of noise/notifications.
    Instead, please use GitHub's web interface to request another review.
    Please read our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/main/.github/contributing.md#resolve-review-comments-instead-of-commenting) to reduce noise.


    Good luck,

    **Please create a GitHub Discussion before continuing with this PR.**


    Thank you for your PR, but we need to discuss the requirements and implementation first.


    The maintainers believe that there is a lack of - or misalignment of - requirements about this PR.
    We need to discuss the requirements and implementation first so that you don't write code that won't be merged.


    This PR will be closed for now to avoid confusion, but you can reopen it after the discussion has been resolved.

    Hi there,


    We're closing this discussion because it's missing some details, or because something else about it made it hard or impossible for us to help resolve the issue.


    We want high quality discussions, so users can search them for answers.
    This means we'll close (and later delete) low quality discussions.


    You are welcome to create a new discussion with more details in future.


    Thanks, the Renovate team.

'auto:bad-vibes':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    A maintainer has flagged this discussion as giving off some bad vibes. **Maintainers will no longer participate in this discussion unless/until such "vibes" are resolved.**


    This is typically when someone is overly critical of the product or the assistance they're receiving.
    Or being unreasonably demanding or lazy, such as refusing to provide logs, or other information, when asked.


    Open Source means you're welcome to use the software with few limits applied.
    But you should _not_ give maintainers a bad day or contribute to Open Source burnout.


    If you feel this message is wrong or due to a misunderstanding, please let us know. If you see this message but don't take it as a sign to cool off or back off, we may close the discussion and block you from the repository.


    If you want to get the discussion back on track, we would like you to:
     - Remove, or edit, the bad vibes parts of your comments
     - Say that you understand the problem (we don't need a lengthy apology)
     - Stop giving off more bad vibes


    Thanks, the Renovate team

'auto:one-topic':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    Please stick to one topic/question per Discussion. Start a new discussion per topic.


    This prevents future users from finding this discussion and getting confused by multiple questions and answers. One question and answer per Discussion works best.


    For example:
     - Don't create a discussion with multiple questions requiring multiple answers
     - If you got an answer to your first question, don't change topic like "Can I also ask you how I might..." which would then require a different answer. Mark the current discussion as answered and open a new one.


    Thanks, the Renovate team

'auto:no-mentions':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    This is intended as a polite, automated _request_ that users avoid `@` mentioning repository maintainers like `@rarkins` or `@viceice`. Doing so causes annoying mobile notifications and makes it harder to maintain this repository.


    We know it might be common elsewhere but we participate in hundreds of discussions a week and would need to turn off GitHub mobile notifications if we were mentioned in every one.


    As a general rule, we will read and respond to all discussions in this repository, so there is no need to mention us.


    Thanks, the Renovate team

'auto:bug-to-idea':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    A maintainer reviewed the information, and decided that this is not a bug. To avoid confusing others, we will close this Discussion. Please keep reading as there is good news too!


    The good news is that the maintainer likes your idea, in general. Please create a new [Suggest an Idea](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/discussions/new?category=suggest-an-idea) Discussion. Feel free to copy/paste what you need from this Discussion. Please focus on the feature request: explain what Renovate should do, and how Renovate can know when/what to do. We may convert that Discussion to an Issue when it is ready. Note that you will still have to wait for a maintainer, or someone else, to do the work needed for your feature.


    Why are we closing your Discussion? For us, bug reports are about things that are not working as intended, or things that are not working as described in the docs. What you found may be bad behavior, but we do not think it is a bug.


    For more details, please read [our development docs about bug handling](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/main/docs/development/bug-handling.md).


    Thanks, the Renovate team

'auto:bug-invalid':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    A maintainer decided this is not a bug, and behaving as designed. The maintainer will explain why this behavior is correct. To avoid confusing future readers, we will close this Discussion.


    We want Bug-type Discussions to be about things that we rate as bugs. For more details, please read [our development docs about bug handling](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/main/docs/development/bug-handling.md).


    If this bug report makes you think of an idea for a new feature, or how to improve a current feature, feel free to create a new [Suggest an Idea](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/discussions/new?category=suggest-an-idea) Discussion.

    Hi there,


    A maintainer confirmed this is a bug, and converted this Discussion to an Issue. If you have more thoughts/info about the bug, please post them in the Issue.


    We will close this Discussion, as we want new info to go in the Issue.

'auto:idea-rewrite':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    The maintainers want to convert this idea into a Feature Request issue. Before we can convert, we need you update the Discussion title and/or the description(s).


    We want the top post, and title, to match the current state of your idea/feature request. This is because a discussion often has lots of info, thoughts and comments. There may also be ideas that turn out to be dead ends. In simple terms, we only want the good stuff to go in the top post.


    So please put the current information in the top post and update the title. Feel free to copy/paste examples, links or comments into the description. Let us know when you are finished updating, and we will convert your discussion to an Issue.


    Thanks, the Renovate team

'auto:no-slas':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    Please remember that there are no Service Level Agreements (SLAs) or roadmap commitments in Open Source projects like Renovate. The maintainers and contributors work on bugs/features/docs at their own pace. This means that sometimes you will have to wait for things to happen, or to get a response.


    Please avoid comments like: "Any update on this?" or "When will this be fixed?". Do not chase a maintainer to get answers quickly. We will block you if you nudge us frequently.


    Please read our [Code of Conduct, how we prioritize work](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#how-we-prioritize-work) to learn more about how we prioritize what to work on.
    If you are a paying Mend.io customer, please tell your support or customer contact that this issue is important to you.


    Thanks, the Renovate team

'auto:reduce-complexity':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    This discussion is too complex, and we want you to simplify. This way you are more likely to get help or a solution.


    For example, if you've pasted your _whole_ complex config, while your problem is about just one part, consider removing the parts that are not relevant to your problem. The best way to do this is to create a [minimal reproduction](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/main/docs/development/minimal-reproductions.md).


    You may have tried many ways to do something, and described all the methods you tried. If none of the methods worked, please focus on the most promising method, or the ideal solution. Avoid complicating the description (or logs) with the failed attempts.


    To summarize: please reduce the complexity of your discussion, to increase the chances of getting help.


    Thanks, the Renovate team

'auto:enterprise-support':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    The maintainers have labeled this discussion as a use case specific to "enterprise" users. Enterprise users typically self-host Renovate and have advanced requirements like custom certificates, HTTP proxies, private registries, air gapping, etc.


    Such cases usually need a lot of back-and-forth to resolve, because the problem is related to the user's environment.
    Usually the user's environment can not be reproduced publicly, which means that maintainer debugging is not possible.


    The maintainers decided their time is best spent on issues that help large numbers of users. This means enterprise-specific issues affecting one user (or a small number of users), are not a priority. If we can help you quickly, we will. But if you see this message, then a maintainer believes this is not a quick fix. The maintainers will not actively work on this issue, unless new information is found.


    If you are an enterprise user, please consider the following options:

      - Troubleshoot and contribute a fix yourself, or
      - [Hire a consultant](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#getting-more-help) to help you, or
      - Consider an [Enterprise support contract from Mend.io](https://mend.io/mend-renovate/), or
      - Wait for a community member to help you, if they have the same problem


    If you choose to wait, then this discussion can remain open indefinitely.
    But please be patient, do not nudge or bump this discussion just to get attention.


    Thanks, the Renovate team
