    You're asking us to support a new package manager.

'auto:no-coverage-ignore':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    You're skipping code tests with `istanbul ignore`.


    Please only skip tests if:
      - you cannot test the code, or
      - the code is very difficult to test, or
      - the edge case won't usually happen at runtime


    If you skip a test, always comment why:


    ```ts
    // istanbul ignore next: typescript strict null check
    if (!url) {
      return null;
    }
    ```


    Good luck,


    The Renovate team

'auto:bad-vibes':
  comment: >
    Hi there,

    A maintainer has flagged this discussion as giving off some bad vibes. **Maintainers will no longer participate in this discussion unless/until such "vibes" are resolved.**


    This is typically when someone is overly critical of the product or the assistance they're receiving.
    Or being unreasonably demanding or lazy, such as refusing to provide logs, or other information, when asked.


    Open Source means you're welcome to use the software with few limits applied.
    But you should _not_ give maintainers a bad day or contribute to Open Source burnout.


    If you feel this message is wrong or due to a misunderstanding, please let us know. If you see this message but don't take it as a sign to cool off or back off, we may close the discussion and block you from the repository.


    If you want to get the discussion back on track, we would like you to:
    - Remove, or edit, the bad vibes parts of your comments
    - Say that you understand the problem (we don't need a lengthy apology)
    - Stop giving off more bad vibes


    If you're unhappy with this, we suggest you stop using the repository discussions or the product altogether.


    Thanks, the Renovate team
