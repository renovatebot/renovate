'reproduction:needed':
  comment: >
    Hi there,


    Get your issue fixed faster by creating a minimal reproduction.
    This means a repository dedicated to reproducing this issue with the minimal dependencies and config possible.


    Before we start working on your issue we need to know exactly what's causing the current behavior.
    A minimal reproduction helps us with this.


    To get started, please read our guide on creating a [minimal reproduction](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/main/docs/development/minimal-reproductions.md).


    We may close the issue if you, or someone else, haven't created a minimal reproduction within two weeks.
    If you need more time, or are stuck, please ask for help or more time in a comment.


    Good luck,


    The Renovate team

    Hi there,


    You're asking us to support a new package manager.
    We need to know some basic information about this package manager first.
    Please copy/paste [the new package manager questionnaire](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/main/docs/development/new-package-manager-template.md), and fill it out in full.


    Once the questionnaire is filled out we'll decide if we want to support this new manager.
