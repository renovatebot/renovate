        Try not to raise a bug report unless you've looked at the logs first.
        If you're running self-hosted, run with `LOG_LEVEL=debug` in your environment variables and search for whatever dependency/branch/PR that is causing the problem.
        If you are using the Renovate App, log into https://app.renovatebot.com/dashboard and locate the correct job log for when the problem occurred (e.g. when the PR was created).
        Paste the *relevant* logs here, not the entire thing and not just a link to the dashboard (others do not have permissions to view them).
      value: |
        <details><summary>Click me to see logs</summary>

        ```
        Copy/paste any log here, between the starting and ending backticks
        ```
