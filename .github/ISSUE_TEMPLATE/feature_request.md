about: Suggest an idea for this project
---

**What would you like Renovate to be able to do?**

<!-- A clear and concise description of what problem needs solving. Make sure you describe what you "really" are trying to achieve (the bigger picture) as that often helps. -->

**Did you already have any implementation ideas?**

<!-- This is totally optional, but we know many people dig into the source code already before raising a request. Try to keep implementation ideas separate from *requirements* above -->

**Are there any workarounds or alternative ideas you've tried to avoid needing this feature?**

**Is this a feature you'd be interested in implementing yourself?**

<!-- Again, totally optional. But let us know if you're interested and if you need any particular help -->
