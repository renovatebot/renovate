about: You've found a bug with Renovate
---

**What Renovate type, platform and version are you using?**

<!-- Tell us if you're using the hosted App, or if you are self-hosted Renovate yourself. Platform too (GitHub, GitLab, etc) plus which version of Renovate if you're self-hosted. -->

**Describe the bug**

<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->

**Relevant debug logs**

<!--
Try not to raise a bug report unless you've looked at the logs first.

If you're running self-hosted, run with `--log-level=debug` or LOG_LEVEL=debug and search for whatever dependency/branch/PR that is causing the problem. If you are using the Renovate App, log into https://app.renovatebot.com/dashboard and locate the correct job log for when the problem occurred (e.g. when the PR was created).

Paste the *relevant* logs here, not the entire thing and not just a link to the dashboard (others do not have permissions to view them).
-->

**To Reproduce**

<!-- To fix a bug, we usually need a *minimal* public repository to reproduce it in, before verifying that our fix works using the same repo. If you provide a public repo that already reproduces the problem, then your bug will get highest priority for fixing. If you can't reproduce it in a simple repo, do your best to describe how it could be reproduced, or under what circumstances the bug occurs, but it's possible that nobody will start work on it if there's no way to reproduce it without a lot of work. -->

**Additional context**

<!-- Add any other context about the problem here, including your own debugging or ideas on what went wrong. -->
