about: You've found a bug with Renovate
---

**What Renovate type, platform and version are you using?**

<!-- Tell us if you're using the hosted App, or if you are self-hosted Renovate yourself. Platform too (GitHub, GitLab, etc) plus which version of Renovate if you're self-hosted. -->

**Describe the bug**

<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->

**Relevant debug logs**

<!--
Try not to raise a bug report unless you've looked at the logs first.

If you're running self-hosted, run with `--log-level=debug` or LOG_LEVEL=debug and search for whatever dependency/branch/PR that is causing the problem. If you are using the Renovate App, log into https://app.renovatebot.com/dashboard and locate the correct job log for when the problem occurred (e.g. when the PR was created).

Paste the *relevant* logs here, not the entire thing and not just a link to the dashboard (others do not have permissions to view them).

**To Reproduce**

<!-- Except for very simple bugs like typos, a debuggable reproduction repository is usually needed. Please read the [minimal reproductions documentation](../../docs/development/minimal-reproductions.md) to learn how to make a good minimal reproduction repository. -->

**Additional context**

<!-- Add any other context about the problem here, including your own debugging or ideas on what went wrong. -->
