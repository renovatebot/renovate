**What package manager do you want Renovate to support?**

<!-- Tell us what requirements you need solving, and be sure to mention too if this is part of any "bigger" problem you're trying to solve. -->

**Did you already have any implementation ideas?**

<!-- In case you've already dug into existing options or source code and have ideas, mention them here. Try to keep implementation ideas separate from *requirements* above -->

<!-- Please also mention here in case this is a feature you'd be interested in writing yourself, so you can be assigned it. -->

**Did you read our documentation on adding a package manager?**

- [ ] I've read the [adding a package manager](../../docs/development/adding-a-package-manager.md) documentation.
