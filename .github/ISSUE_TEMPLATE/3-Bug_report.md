about: You've found a bug with Renovate
---

**What Renovate type are you using?**

<!-- Tell us if you're using the hosted App, or if you are self-hosted Renovate yourself. Platform too (GitHub, GitLab, etc) if you think it's relevant. -->

**Describe the bug**

<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->

**Did you see anything helpful in debug logs?**

<!-- If you're running self-hosted, run with `--log-level=debug` or LOG_LEVEL=debug and search for whatever dependency/branch/PR that is causing the problem. If you are using the Renovate App, log into https://app.renovatebot.com/dashboard and locate the correct job log for when the problem occurred (e.g. when the PR was created). The Job ID will help us locate it. -->

**To Reproduce**

<!-- To fix a bug, we nearly always need a *minimal* repo to reproduce it in, before verifying that our fix works using the same repo. If you provide a public repo that already reproduces the problem, then your bug will get highest priority for fixing. If you can't reproduce it in a simple repo, do your best to describe how it could be reproduced, or under what circumstances the bug occurs. -->

**Additional context**

<!-- Add any other context about the problem here, including your own debugging or ideas on what went wrong. -->
