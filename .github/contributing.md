## Security

If you think you've found a **security issue**, please do not mention it in this repository. Instead, email security@renovatebot.com with as much details as possible so that it can be handled confidentially.

## Support

If you have a **configuration question**, please create an issue in https://github.com/renovatebot/config-help

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

If you've found a **bug** or have a **feature request** then please create an issue in this repository (but search first in case a similar issue already exists).

## Code

If you would like to fix a bug or implement a feature, please fork the repository and create a Pull Request. More information on getting set up locally can be found in [docs/development/local-development.md](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/master/docs/development/local-development.md).

Before you start any Pull Request, it's recommended that you create an issue to discuss
first if you have any doubts about requirement or implementation. That way you can be sure that the maintainer(s)
agree on what to change and how, and you can hopefully get a quick merge
afterwards. Also, let the maintainers know that you plan to work on a particular issue so that no one else starts any duplicate work.

Pull Requests can only be merged once all status checks are green, which means `yarn test` passes, and coverage is 100%.

## Slack collaboration with maintainers

We won't lie - sometimes the codebase can be a challenge to navigate. We don't want you spending an hour trying to work out something that might take us a minute to explain.

For that reason, we host a Slack channel dedicated to helping anyone who's working on PRs for Renovate. It's strictly developers-only and not intended for general support, so please email support@renovatebot.com to ask to be added.

## Legal

Pull Request authors must sign the [Renovate CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/renovateapp/renovate).

If you cannot or do not want to sign this CLA (e.g. your employment contract for your employer may not allow this), you should not submit a PR. Open an issue and someone else can do the work.
