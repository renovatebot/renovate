# Contributing

If you think you've found a **security issue**, please do not mention it in this repository. Instead, email security@renovateapp.com with as much details as possible so that it can be handled confidentially.

If you have a **configuration question**, please create an issue in https://github.com/renovateapp/config-help

If you've found a **bug** or have a **feature request** then please create an issue here (but search first in case it already exists).

If you would like to fix a bug or implement a feature, please fork the repository and create a Pull Request. More information on getting set up locally can be found in [docs/local-development.md](https://github.com/renovateapp/renovate/blob/master/docs/local-development.md).

Before you start any Pull Request, it's recommended that you create an issue to discuss
first if you have any doubts about requirement or implementation. That way you can be sure that the maintainer(s)
agree on what to change and how, and you can hopefully get a quick merge
afterwards. Also, let the maintainers know that you plan to work on a particular issue so that no one else starts any duplicate work.

Pull Requests can only be merged once all status checks are green, which means `yarn test` passes, and coverage is 100%.
