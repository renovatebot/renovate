# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and desirable, in the form of:

- Bug reports (raise an issue)
- Feature requests (raise an issue)
- Code (submit a Pull Request)
- Comments (comment on any of the above)

Before you submit any code, it's recommended that you raise an issue first if you have any doubts. That way you can be sure that the maintainer(s) agree on what to change and how, and you can hopefully get a quick merge afterwards.

## Running the source code locally

After you have cloned the project, first check that it's running OK locally.

`renovate` supports node versions 6 and above. It is written using async/await so either needs `babel` transpilation for node 6, or a harmony flag for node 7.

If running in node 6, you need to run a transpiled version of the code. You can do this without an explicit transpilation step by running `npm run start-babel`.
Examples:

```sh
$ npm run start-babel username/reponame
$ LOG_LEVEL=verbose npm run start-babel username/reponame
$ npm run start-babel -- --labels=foo username/reponame
```

If running on node 7, you can run just like the above, but use the `npm run start-raw` command instead of `npm run start-babel`.

## Adding configuration options

We wish to keep backwards-compatibility as often as possible, as well as make the code configurable, so most new functionality should be controllable via configuration options.
Please see [Cofiguration docs](docs/configuration.md) for a list of current options.

If you wish to add one, add it to `lib/config/definitions.js` and then run `npm run update-docs`.

## Running tests

You can run `npm test` locally to test your code. We don't have 100% coverage so new tests are desirable. We also run Continuous Integration using CircleCI.
