# General

- This project uses `pnpm`, use it instead of `npm`, `yarn`, `npx`, etc.

# Running tests

Run `pnpm vitest path/to/file.spec.ts`.
This is alias for `pnpm run vitest` defined in `package.json`.

# Code style

- Avoid excessive nesting by using "early exit" style of functions (`return`) and loops (`break` and `continue`).
