## Why Use Renovate?

* Receive automated Pull Requests whenever dependencies need updating. Or whenever you schedule it for.
* Renovate discovers and processes all dependency files in a repository (e.g. supports
  monorepo architecture such as lerna or yarn workspaces)
* Extremely customisable behaviour via configuration files or within your `package.json`
* Use eslint-like shared config presets for ease of use and simplifying configuration
* Update lock files natively in the same commit, including immediately resolving conflicts whenever PRs are merged
* Supports GitHub, GitLab (APIv4) and VSTS. BitBucket is a WIP.
* Open source (installable via npm/yarn) so can be self-hosted or used for free via GitHub App

## The Renovate Approach

* Everyone can benefit from automation, whether it's a little or a lot
* Renovate should not cause you to change your workflow against your wishes - don't enforce opinions on users
* All behaviour should be configurable, down to a ridiculous level if desired
* Autodetect settings wherever possible (to minimise configuration) but always allow overrides

## Using Renovate

The easiest way to use Renovate if you are on GitHub is to enable the free Renovate app. Go to

[Configuration](https://github.com/renovateapp/renovate/blob/master/docs/configuration.md)
and
[Configuration FAQ](https://github.com/renovateapp/renovate/blob/master/docs/faq.md)
