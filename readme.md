## The Renovate Approach

We believe everyone benefits from automation, whether it's a little or a lot.
This means that Renovate:

- Adapts to your workflow
- Allows you to configure its behavior
- Will autodetect settings where possible

## Using Renovate

Get started with Renovate by checking out our [tutorial](https://github.com/renovatebot/tutorial).

### GitHub

It's easiest to use the hosted Renovate app.
Install the [Renovate app](https://github.com/apps/renovate) now.

[More details on the GitHub App installation](https://docs.renovatebot.com/getting-started/installing-onboarding/).

### Azure DevOps

There are two ways to run Renovate on Azure DevOps:

- Renovate Me extension
- Custom pipeline

#### Renovate Me extension

Go to the Visual Studio Marketplace and install the [Renovate Me](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jyc.vsts-extensions-renovate-me) extension in your organization.
From there you can create a pipeline with the `RenovateMe` task.

> **Note**
> This extension is created and maintained personally by a Renovate developer/user so support requests relating to the extension itself cannot be answered directly in the main Renovate repository.

#### Custom pipeline

You can create a custom pipeline with a `yml` definition that triggers `npx renovate`.
[More details on how to configure the pipeline](https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/platform/azure/).

### Bitbucket Cloud/Server, Forgejo, Gitea, GitLab

For Bitbucket Cloud, Bitbucket Server, Forgejo, Gitea and GitLab, use our self-hosting option.

## Configuration

Go to our [documentation website](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) to learn how to configure Renovate.
We have a [full list of configuration options](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/).

To get help with your configuration, go to the [discussions tab in the Renovate repository](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/discussions) and open a new "config help" discussion post.

## Self-Hosting

To run your own instance of Renovate you have several options:

- Install the `renovate` CLI tool from npmjs, run it on a schedule (e.g. using `cron`)
- Run the `renovate/renovate:full` Docker Hub image (same content/versions as the CLI tool), run it on a schedule
- Run the `renovate/renovate:latest` Docker Hub image if you only use package managers that don't need third-party binaries (e.g. JavaScript, Docker, NuGet, pip)

[More details on the self-hosting development](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/main/docs/usage/getting-started/running.md).
