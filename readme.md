# renovate

> Keep npm dependencies up-to-date

##  Why

- Creates or updates Pull Requests for each dependency that needs updating
- Discovers and processes all `package.json` files in repository (supports monorepo architecture)
- Supports multiple major versions per-dependency at once
- Configurable via file, environment, CLI, and `package.json`
- Self-hosted

Inspired by the services at [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io) and [Doppins](https://doppins.com).

## Install

```
$ npm install -g renovate
```

## Authentication

You need to select a GitHub user for `renovate` to assume the identity of. It's recommended that you use a dedicated "bot" account for this to avoid user confusion.

The script will need a GitHub Personal Access Token with "repo" permissions. You can find instructions for generating it here: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/

This token needs to be configured via file, environment variable, or CLI. See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for details.
The simplest way is to expose it as `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
