## Why Use Renovate?

- Receive automated Pull Requests whenever dependencies need updating.
- Define schedules to avoid unnecessary noise in projects (e.g. for weekends or outside of working hours, or weekly updates, etc)
- Relevant package files are discovered automatically (e.g. supports
  monorepo architecture such as lerna or yarn workspaces without further configuration)
- Bot behaviour is extremely customisable via configuration files (config as code)
- Use eslint-like shared config presets for ease of use and simplifying configuration
- Lock files are natively supported and updated in the same commit, including immediately resolving conflicts whenever PRs are merged
- Supports GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket and VSTS.
- Open source (installable via npm/yarn or Docker Hub) so can be self-hosted or used via GitHub App

## The Renovate Approach

- We believe everyone can benefit from automation, whether it's a little or a lot
- Renovate should not cause you to change your workflow against your wishes, instead it should be adaptable to your existing workflow
- All behaviour should be configurable, down to a ridiculous level if necessary
- Autodetect settings wherever possible (to minimise configuration) but always allow overrides

## Using Renovate

The easiest way to use Renovate if you are on GitHub is to use the Renovate app. Go to
[https://github.com/marketplace/renovate](https://github.com/marketplace/renovate) to install
it now. A paid plan is required for private repositories.

## Configuration

Visit https://renovatebot.com/docs/ for documentation, and in particular https://renovatebot.com/docs/configuration-options/ for a list of configuration options.

You can also raise an issue in https://github.com/renovatebot/config-help if you'd like to get your config reviewed or ask any questions.

## Self-Hosting

If you are not on GitHub or you prefer to run your own instance of Renovate then you have several options:

- Install the `renovate` CLI tool from npmjs
- Run the `renovate/renovate` Docker Hub image (same content/versions as the CLI tool)
- Use [Renovate Pro Edition](https://renovatebot.com/pro) available for GitHub Enterprise and soon GitLab too

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to Renovate or get a local copy running for some other reason, please see the instructions in [contributing.md](.github/contributing.md).

## Security / Disclosure

If you discover any important bug with Renovate that may pose a security problem, please disclose it confidentially to security@renovatebot.com first, so that it can be assessed and hopefully fixed prior to being exploited. Please do not raise GitHub issues for security-related doubts or problems.
