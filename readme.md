# What is the Mend Renovate CLI?

Renovate is an automated dependency update tool.
It helps to update dependencies in your code without needing to do it manually.
When Renovate runs on your repo, it looks for references to dependencies (both public and private) and, if there are newer versions available, Renovate can create pull requests to update your versions automatically.

## Features

- Delivers update PRs directly to your repo
  - Relevant package files are discovered automatically
  - Pull Requests automatically generated in your repo
- Provides useful information to help you decide which updates to accept (age, adoption, pass rates, merge confidence)
- Highly configurable and flexible to fit in with your needs and repository standards
- Largest collection of languages and platforms (listed below)
- Connects with private repositories and package registries

### Languages

Renovate can provide updates for most popular languages, platforms, and registries including: npm, Java, Python, .NET, Scala, Ruby, Go, Docker and more.
Supports over [90 different package managers](https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/).

### Platforms

Renovate updates code repositories on the following platforms: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, AWS Code Commit, Gitea, Forgejo, Gerrit (experimental)

## Ways to run Renovate

The most effective way to run Renovate is to use an automated job scheduling system that regularly runs Renovate on all enabled repositories and responds with priority to user activity.
Mend offers cloud-hosted and self-hosted solutions.

### Other ways to run Renovate

#### Run Renovate on your Pipeline

Mend provides a _**GitHub Action**_ or a _**GitLab Runner**_ to help you run Renovate as a CI pipeline job.

- GitHub Action: [renovatebot/github-action](https://github.com/renovatebot/github-action).
- GitLab Runner: [Renovate Runner project](https://gitlab.com/renovate-bot/renovate-runner/)

  _Note: This extension is created and maintained personally by a Renovate developer/user. Support requests for the extension will not be answered directly in the main Renovate repository._
- Custom pipeline: You can create a custom pipeline with a **yml** definition that triggers **npx renovate**. [More details on how to configure the pipeline](https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/platform/azure/).
