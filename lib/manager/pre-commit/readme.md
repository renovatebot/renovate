Renovate supports updating of Git dependencies within pre-commit configuration `.pre-commit-config.yaml` files or other YAML files that use the same format (via `fileMatch` configuration).
Updates are performed if the files follow the conventional format used in typical pre-commit files:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v1.0.0
    hooks:
      - id: some-hook-id
```
