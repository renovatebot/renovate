`gradle-lite` is an an alternate manager for Gradle, and is written in JavaScript.
The main benefit of `gradle-lite` is that it skips the slow Gradle commands.

You can use the default `gradle` manager and `gradle-lite` at the same time.

If you like the commits from `gradle-lite`, you can use `gradle-lite` as a complete replacement for the default manager.
