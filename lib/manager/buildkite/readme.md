## Overview

#### Name of package manager

[Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/plugins)

---

#### Implementation status

Implemented

---

#### What language does this support?

N/A

---

#### Does that language have other (competing?) package managers?

N/A

## Package File Detection

#### What type of package files and names does it use?

> Filenames can be custom, but the tool automatically looks in:
>
> - buildkite.yml
> - buildkite.yaml
> - buildkite.json
> - .buildkite/pipeline.yml
> - .buildkite/pipeline.yaml
> - .buildkite/pipeline.json

---

#### What [fileMatch](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#filematch) pattern(s) should be used?

`['buildkite\\.ya?ml', '\\.buildkite/.+\\.ya?ml$']`

---

#### Is it likely that many users would need to extend this pattern for custom file names?

Only a small percentage of Buildkite users should need to add additional `fileMatch` patterns.

---

#### Is the fileMatch pattern likely to get many "false hits" for files that have nothing to do with package management?

Unlikely

## Parsing and Extraction

#### Can package files have "local" links to each other that need to be resolved?

No

#### Is there reason why package files need to be parsed together (in serial) instead of independently?

No

---

#### What format/syntax is the package file in? e.g. JSON, TOML, custom?

YAML is recommended. JSON is possible but won't be supported.

---

#### How do you suggest parsing the file? Using an off-the-shelf parser, using regex, or can it be custom-parsed line by line?

Parsing YAML line-by-line, looking only for the lines that interest us.

---

#### Does the package file structure distinguish between different "types" of dependencies? e.g. production dependencies, dev dependencies, etc?

No

---

#### List all the sources/syntaxes of dependencies that can be extracted:

From https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/plugins#plugin-sources:

> If you refer to a plugin just by name, it defaults to `https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/<name>-buildkite-plugin`. For example, a plugin name of `docker` would resolve to `https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/docker-buildkite-plugin`.
>
> To refer to a plugin in your own GitHub organization, prefix the name with the organization. For example, a plugin name of `my-org/docker` would resolve to `https://github.com/my-org/docker-buildkite-plugin`.
>
> The following are not supported and skipped over:

> You can also use fully qualified Git URLs instead of names, to refer to plugins that arenâ€™t on GitHub, or live in private Git repositories only accessible to your agents. For example:

```
https://github.com/my-org/my-plugin.git#v1.0.0
ssh://git@github.com/my-org/my-plugin.git#v1.0.0
file:///a-local-path/my-plugin.git#v1.0.0
Branches, tags and commits are all valid after the #.
```

---

#### Describe which types of dependencies above are supported and which will be implemented in future:

The two short forms of GitHub dependencies described above are supported, but fully qualified Git URLs are not.

## Versioning

#### What versioning scheme do the package files use?

Semver

---

#### Does this versioning scheme support range constraints, e.g. `^1.0.0` or `1.x`?

No

---

#### Is this package manager used for applications, libraries, or both? If both, is there a way to tell which is which?

Everything can be thought of as an application.

---

#### If ranges are supported, are there any cases when Renovate should pin ranges to exact versions if rangeStrategy=auto?

N/A because syntax doesn't support ranges.

## Lookup

#### Is a new datasource required? Provide details

No, it can use existing GitHub datasource (tags).

---

#### Will users need the capability to specify a custom host/registry to look up? Can it be found within the package files, or within other files inside the repository, or would it require Renovate configuration?

No.

---

#### Do the package files contain any "constraints" on the parent language (e.g. supports only v3.x of Python) or platform (Linux, Windows, etc) that should be used in the lookup procedure?

No

---

#### Will users need the ability to configure language or other constraints using Renovate config?

No

## Artifacts

#### Are lock files or checksum files used? Mandatory?

Not in use

---

#### If so, what tool and exact commands should be used if updating 1 or more package versions in a dependency file?

N/A

---

#### If applicable, describe how the tool maintains a cache and if it can be controlled via CLI or env? Do you recommend the cache be kept or disabled/ignored?

N/A

---

#### If applicable, what command should be used to generate a lock file from scratch if you already have a package file? This will be used for "lock file maintenance".

N/A

## Other

#### Is there anything else to know about this package manager?

Buildkite is a great service and the company uses Renovate!
