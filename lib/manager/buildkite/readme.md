# Package Manager Description

*Name of package manager*: 

[Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/plugins)

---

*What language does this support?*

N/A

---

*Does that language have other (competing?) package managers?* 

N/A

---

*What type of package files and names does it use?* 

Filenames can be custom, but the rool automatically looks in:

   - buildkite.yml
   - buildkite.yaml
   - buildkite.json
   - .buildkite/pipeline.yml
   - .buildkite/pipeline.yaml
   - .buildkite/pipeline.json

---

*What [fileMatch](https://renovatebot.com/docs/configuration-options/#filematch) pattern(s) should be used?* 

`['\\.buildkite/.+\\.yml$']`

---

*Is it likely that many users would need to extend this pattern for custom file names?*

It's quite likely that some users would need to add customer file matches.

---

*Is the fileMatch pattern likely to get many "false hits"?*

Unlikely

---

*If a repository contains more than one package file, can they have dependencies on each other or is there any reason why they need to be read/parsed in serial instead of in parallel/independently?*

No

---

*What format/syntax is the package file in? e.g. JSON, toml, custom?*

YAML is recommended

---

*How do you suggest parsing the file? Using an off-the-shelf parser, using regex, or can it be custom-parsed line by line?*

Parsing line-by-line.

---

*Does the package file distinguish between different "types" of dependencies? e.g. production dependencies, dev dependencies, etc? Or are they normally split into different files?*

No

---

*What versioning scheme do the package files use?*

Semver

---

*Does this versioning scheme support range constraints, e.g. `^1.0.0` or `1.x`?*

No

---

*Do the package files contain references to which registries/hosts should be used for looking up package versions?*

No

---

*Do the package files contain any "constraints" on the parent language (e.g. supports only v3.x of Python) or platform (Linux, Windows, etc)?*

N/A

---

*If the package files contain language or platform restrictions, are these used in the lookup of package versions?*

N/A

---

*Are there any types of dependencies or types of versions that Renovate should ignore?*

Those without versions.

---

*Is this package manager used for applications, libraries, or both? If both, is there a way to tell which is which?*

Everything can be thought of as an application and therefore can be pinned.

---

*What type of package URLs/datasources are likely to be extracted? e.g. custom registry, github URLs, etc?*

From https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/plugins#plugin-sources:

> If you refer to a plugin just by name, it defaults to `https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/<name>-buildkite-plugin`. For example, a plugin name of `docker` would resolve to `https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/docker-buildkite-plugin`.
>
> To refer to a plugin in your own GitHub organization, prefix the name with the organization. For example, a plugin name of `my-org/docker` would resolve to `https://github.com/my-org/docker-buildkite-plugin`.
> 
> The following are not supported and skipped over:

> You can also use fully qualified Git URLs instead of names, to refer to plugins that arenâ€™t on GitHub, or live in private Git repositories only accessible to your agents. For example:

```
https://github.com/my-org/my-plugin.git#v1.0.0
ssh://git@github.com/my-org/my-plugin.git#v1.0.0
file:///a-local-path/my-plugin.git#v1.0.0
Branches, tags and commits are all valid after the #.
```

---

*Describe which types of dependencies are supported and which will be implemented in future:*

The two short forms of GitHub dependencies described above are supported, but fully qualified Git URLs are not.

---

*Is a new datasource required? Provide details*

No, it can use existing GitHub datasource (tags).

---

*Should Renovate default to pinning dependencies if it's of type "application"?*

N/A because syntax doesn't support ranges.

---

*Are lock files or checksum files used? Mandatory?*

Not in use

---

*If so, what tool and exact commands should be used if updating 1 or more package versions in a dependency file?*

N/A

---

*If applicable, describe how the tool maintains a cache and if it can be controlled via CLI or env? Do you recommend the cache be kept or disabled/ignored?*

N/A

---

*If applicable, what command should be used to generate a lock file from scratch if you already have a package file? This will be used for "lock file maintenance".*

N/A

---

*Is there anything else to know about this package manager?*

Buildkite is a great service and they are active users of Renovate!
