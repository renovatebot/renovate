  ;; "Managed Dependencies" are a concept borrowed from maven pom files; see

  ;; Managed dependencies allow you to specify a desired version number for a dependency

  ;;  will not actually cause the described artifact to be a dependency on its own.
  ;; This feature is most useful in combination with some other mechanism for
  ;;  defining a "parent project"; e.g. you can have a "parent project" that specifies
  ;;  managed dependencies for common libraries that you use frequently in your other
  ;;  projects, and then the downstream/child projects can specify a normal dependency on
  ;;  those libraries *without specifying a version number*, and thus will inherit
  ;;  the version number from the parent.  This provides a simpler means of keeping
  ;;  common dependency versions in sync across a large number of clojure libraries.
  ;; For more info see ./doc/MANAGED_DEPS.md and https://github.com/achin/lein-parent

  ;; go on to perform another `change version` or `vcs` task, instead leaving
