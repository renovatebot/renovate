In this case, if a parent SHA1 was also provided, then it is asserted that the parent is the branch's tip/HEAD at the time the request is made. When this is not the case, a 409 is returned.
  // This API cannot be used to create new anonymous heads in Mercurial repositories.
  // When a new branch name is specified (that does not already exist in the repo), and no parent SHA1s are provided, then the new commit will inherit from the current main branch's tip/HEAD commit, but not advance the main branch. The new commit will be the new branch. When the request also specifies a parent SHA1, then the new commit and branch are created directly on top of the parent commit, regardless of the state of the main branch.

  // This API cannot be used to create additional root commits in non-empty repos.
  // The branch field cannot be repeated.
  // As a side effect, this API can be used to create a new branch without modifying any files, by specifying a new branch name in this field, together with parents, but omitting the files fields, while not sending any files. This will create a new commit and branch with the same contents as the first parent. The diff of this commit against its first parent will be empty.

  // Optional field that declares the files that the request is manipulating. When adding a new file to a repo, or when overwriting an existing file, the client can just upload the full contents of the file in a normal form field and the use of this files meta data field is redundant. However, when the files field contains a file path that does not have a corresponding, identically-named form field, then Bitbucket interprets that as the client wanting to replace the named file with the null set and the file is deleted instead.
  // Paths in the repo that are referenced in neither files nor an individual file field, remain unchanged and carry over from the parent to the new commit.
  // This API does not support renaming as an explicit feature. To rename a file, simply delete it and recreate it under the new name in the same commit.
