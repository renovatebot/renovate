# Bitbucket Cloud

Bitbucket Cloud support is considered in "beta" release status. Mostly, it just needs more feedback/testing. If you have been using it and think it's reliable, please let us know.

## Unsupported platform features/concepts

- Adding assignees to PRs not supported (does not seem to be a Bitbucket concept)

## Features requiring implementation

- Creating issues not implemented yet, e.g. when there is a config error
- Adding comments to PRs not implemented yet, e.g. when a PR has been edited or has a lockfile error
