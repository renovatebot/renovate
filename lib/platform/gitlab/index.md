## Features awaiting implementation

- The `automergeStrategy` configuration option has not been implemented for this platform, and all values behave as if the value `auto` was used. Renovate will accept the Merge Request without further configuration, and respect the strategy defined in the Merge Request, and this cannot be overridden yet
