##  [09-06-2018]
### Improvement
* Changes to add functionality, and allow multiple path variables, to the URI path as well as make it simpler.  [PH-16970](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-16970)

# Current Version: 4.3.1 [03-26-2019]

## New Features
* __3.10.0 [12-05-2018]__ - New methods have been add to:



support failover - there is a method (setFailover) that can be called by adapters to get the proper failover code.

support verifying capabilities - there is a method (verifyCapability) which will verify that the adapter supports the entity, action and specific entities (Array).

support caching entities - the verifyCapability used a cache of entities. This cache can be 'local' memory or in 'redis' based on the cache_location property. You can add entity lists into the cache using the addEntityCache method.

 [PH-21980](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-21980)
* __3.9.0 [12-04-2018]__ - The external name on schemas can now be at the same level or lower -- 

It can still be sys_id or it can be something like ticket.sys_id this allows translation to be done at different levels. [PH-20788](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-20788)
* __3.6.0 [11-16-2018]__ - The process to check the action files for validity has been moved into adapter-utils to reduce the code in the adapter-template. This also moves the actionSchema.json into the adapter-utils. [PH-20797](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-20797)
* __3.5.0 [11-16-2018]__ - Removed the requirement for the properties -authentication.token_URI_path, healthcheck.URI_path and healthcheck.protocol. These can now be taken care of in the .system entity. [PH-20778](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-20778)
* __2.1.0 [08-17-2018]__ - These libraries now support token re-use and expiration during the calls to the external system. [PH-14296](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-14296)
* __2.0.0 [08-13-2018]__ - The following issues are in this Sprint Branch 

PH-16044 -- Add Generic call that is protocol and method independent

PH-16024 -- Mock data should not have to include the internal response information

PH-16125 -- Add Proxy capability to the connection

PH-15075 -- Support Base64 encoding on authentication

PH-14311 -- Adapter not returning errors on two phase calls (need to get token and then make call) and it is then running the second call.

PH-16053 -- Ability to encrypt/decrypt properties (passwords)

PH-16141 -- converted actions to an array and removed redundant data from response object

PH-16239 -- Change the path to read {} instead of <> when going through the entitypath

PH-16268 -- Change the type in the action.json response as single and multiple are confusing

PH-15718 -- Consistent returns that include status and code [PH-16131](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-16131)

## Improvements
* __4.2.1 [03-19-2019]__ - Updated calls to support MongoDB driver 3.1.7. [PH-28266](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-28266)
* __4.2.0 [02-25-2019]__ - Added getAllCapability call for IAP

Added refreshProperties so the adapter can take in new properties without having to restart it. [PH-24808](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-24808)
* __4.0.0 [02-08-2019]__ - Adapter-utils changed error and response objects to match the new standard. This is a breaking change so when using this with your adapter, make sure you handle these new objects. [PH-25372](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-25372)
* __3.13.2 [01-16-2019]__ - Added other REST Methods that were not available - OPTIONS, HEAD, TRACE, CONNECT. [PH-24158](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-24158)
* __3.12.0 [01-02-2019]__ - Added a base_path property and the ability to set {basePath} on the entitypath in the action files. [PH-23339](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-23339)
* __3.11.0 [01-02-2019]__ - Added the capability to have a timeout per action defined in the action.js. This timeout overrides the attempt_timeout property when it is provided. [PH-22466](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-22466)
* __3.7.0 [11-16-2018]__ - Adapter can now use expiration time returned on a token request for when the token expires. In addition, tokens can be stored in either local memory or redis. The later will survive an adapter restart. [PH-20803](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-20803)
* __3.4.0 [11-09-2018]__ - Adds an icode field to the error returns that will be used to determine if the request can be failed over to another adapter or not. [PH-20677](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-20677)
* __3.3.0 [10-12-2018]__ - Adapter-utils now supports defining the healthcheck and token in either the properties or in their own action files. [PH-18536](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-18536)
* __3.2.0 [09-26-2018]__ - Added support for version parameter on the entitypath for an action and a property so that the version only needs to be changed in a property. [PH-18530](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-18530)
* __3.1.0 [09-26-2018]__ - Added the ability to bypass translation on the returned data. [PH-17702](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-17702)

# Previous Version: 1.3.2 [08-03-2018]

## New Features
* 1.2.0 [07-03-2018] Added the ability to define separate request and response schemas for an action. Three potential fields on each action in the action.json:
  - schema - this remains the best way to define a single schema for the action
  - requestSchema - this supersedes schema for requests going to the external sytem
  - responseSchema - this supersedes schema for requests coming from the external system. [PH-12811](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-12811)
* 1.1.0 [06-25-2018] Added the ability for the data translator utility to handle objects with dynamic fields. [PH-12808](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-12808)
* 1.0.19 [06-08-2018] Update CHANGELOG to reflect new format [PH-11323](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-11323)
