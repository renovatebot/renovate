# Bitbucket Cloud

Most of the information on this page is meant for users who want to self-host Renovate on Bitbucket Cloud.

## Easiest way to run Renovate

For most users, the easiest way to get started is to install [the Mend app for Bitbucket](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1232072/mend?tab=overview&hosting=cloud) and use the free Renovate plan.
When you use the app, Mend will:

- authenticate the app to Bitbucket Cloud
- keep the tokens safe
- maintain and update the Renovate version used

If you self-host Renovate you must do the things listed above yourself.
Self-hosting is meant for users with advanced use cases, or who want to be in full control of the bot and the environment it runs in.
We recommend most users install the Mend app.

Read the [Security and Permissions](../../../security-and-permissions.md) page to learn about the Security and Permissions needed for the Mend app.

After you installed the hosted app, please read the [reading list](../../../reading-list.md) to learn how to use and configure Renovate.

## Authentication

First, [create an API token](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/create-an-api-token/) for the bot account.
Give the bot API token the following permission scopes:

| Permission                                                                                                               | Scope                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| [`read:repository:bitbucket`](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#read-repository-bitbucket)     | Repository: Read     |
| [`read:pullrequest:bitbucket`](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#read-pullrequest-bitbucket)   | Pull requests: Read  |
| [`write:pullrequest:bitbucket`](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#write-pullrequest-bitbucket) | Pull requests: Write |
| [`read:user:bitbucket`](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#read-user-bitbucket)                 | User: Read           |
| [`read:issue:bitbucket`](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#read-issue-bitbucket)               | Issues: Read         |
| [`write:issue:bitbucket`](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#write-issue-bitbucket)             | Issues: Write        |
| [`read:workspace:bitbucket`](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#read-workspace-bitbucket)       | Workspace: Read      |

The bot also needs to validate the workspace membership status of pull-request reviewers, for that, [create a new user group](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/organize-workspace-members-into-groups/) in the workspace with the **Create repositories** permission and add the bot user to it.

Let Renovate use your API token by doing _one_ of the following:

- Set your API token as a `password` in your `config.js` file
- Set your API token as an environment variable `RENOVATE_PASSWORD`
- Set your API token when you run Renovate in the CLI with `--password=`

Remember to:

- Set the `username` for the bot account, which is your Atlassian account email. You can find your email through "Personal Bitbucket settings" on the "Email aliases" page for your account
- Set `platform=bitbucket` somewhere in your Renovate config file

## Unsupported platform features/concepts

- Adding assignees to PRs not supported (does not seem to be a Bitbucket concept)
- `automergeStrategy=rebase` not supported by Bitbucket Cloud, see [Jira issue BCLOUD-16610](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-16610)
