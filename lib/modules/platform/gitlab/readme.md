# GitLab

## Authentication

You can authenticate Renovate to GitLab, with a Personal Access Token, or Group Access Token.

To start, create either:

- a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) for the bot account
- or a [Group Access Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/settings/group_access_tokens.html#bot-users-for-groups) for the bot account

The bot account must have at least the Developer role in order to [create issues and merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html#project-members-permissions).
If you are using automerge, the bot account must have the appropriate ["Allowed to merge" permission on the protected branch](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected_branches.html#require-everyone-to-submit-merge-requests-for-a-protected-branch) of your projects.
If merging is restricted to Maintainers, the bot account must have the Maintainer role.

If you are using a group access token, to keep using the same GitLab-generated bot user you must [rotate/refresh the Group Access Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/group_access_tokens.html#rotate-a-group-access-token) _before_ the token's expiry date.

We refer to personal access tokens and group access tokens as _access tokens_ in the instructions that follow.

For real runs, give the access token these scopes:

- `api`
- `write_repository`
- `read_registry` (only if Renovate needs to access the [GitLab Container registry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/))

For dry runs, give the access token these scopes:

- `read_api`
- `read_repository`
- `read_registry` (only if Renovate needs to access the [GitLab Container registry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/))

Let Renovate use your access token by doing _one_ of the following:

- Set your access token as a `token` in your `config.js` file
- Set your access token as an environment variable `RENOVATE_TOKEN`
- Set your access token when you run Renovate in the CLI with `--token=`

Remember to set `platform=gitlab` somewhere in your Renovate config file.

If you're using a private [GitLab container registry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/), you must:

- Set the `RENOVATE_HOST_RULES` CI variable to `[{"matchHost": "${CI_REGISTRY}","username": "${GITLAB_USER_NAME}","password": "${RENOVATE_TOKEN}", "hostType": "docker"}]`.
- Make sure the user that owns the access token is a member of the corresponding GitLab projects/groups with the right permissions.
- Make sure the access token has the `read_registry` scope.

You may want to set `FORCE_COLOR: 3` or `TERM: ansi` to the job, in order to get colored output.
[GitLab Runner runs the container’s shell in non-interactive mode, so the shell’s `TERM` environment variable is set to `dumb`.](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/script.html#job-log-output-is-not-formatted-as-expected-or-contains-unexpected-characters)

## Features awaiting implementation

- The `automergeStrategy` configuration option has not been implemented for this platform, and all values behave as if the value `auto` was used. Renovate will accept the Merge Request without further configuration, and respect the strategy defined in the Merge Request, and this cannot be overridden yet

## Server version dependent features

We use the GitLab [version API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/version.html) to fetch the server version.
You can use the experimental feature flag [`RENOVATE_X_PLATFORM_VERSION`](../../../self-hosted-experimental.md#renovate_x_platform_version) to set a specific server version.
By setting the server version yourself, you save a API call that fetches the server version.

- Use `Draft:` MR prefix instead of `WIP:` prefix since `v13.2.0`
- Do not truncate Markdown body to 25K chars since `v13.4.0`
- Allow configure reviewers since `v13.9.0`

## Multiple merge request assignees

Due to licensing restrictions [multiple assignees](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/multiple_assignees_for_issues.html) are only available in GitLab Premium self-managed, GitLab Premium SaaS, and higher tiers.
Because of a safeguard in [GitLab's API](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/pull/14212#issuecomment-1040189712) if multiple assignees are set, but not available to the project, only the first assignee will be applied.
