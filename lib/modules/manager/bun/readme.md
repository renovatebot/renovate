Used for updating bun projects.
Bun is a tool for JavaScript projects and therefore an alternative to managers like npm, pnpm and Yarn.

If a `package.json` is found to be part of `bun` manager results then the same file will be excluded from the `npm` manager results unless an npm/pnpm/Yarn lock file is also found.
