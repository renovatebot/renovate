Keeps the [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration.html#mise-toml) `.mise.toml` file updated.

`mise` supports versioning for many different tools (through it's [own plugins](https://github.com/jdx/mise/tree/main/src/plugins/core) and [asdf plugins](https://mise.jdx.dev/registry.html)).
Therefore, specific tool support must be added one-by-one.

The following tools are currently supported:

<!-- Autogenerate in https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate -->
<!-- Autogenerate end -->

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! note
    Only the first version entry for each supported tool is managed, due to `.mise.toml` supporting fallback versions.
