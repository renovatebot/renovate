Renovate supports updating Helm Chart references in vendir.yml via the [vendir](https://carvel.dev/vendir/) tool. Renovate requires the presence of a [vendir lock file](https://carvel.dev/vendir/docs/v0.40.x/vendir-lock-spec/) which is generated by vendir and should be stored in source code.

It supports both https and oci helm chart repositories.

```yaml title="Example vendir.yml"
apiVersion: vendir.k14s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Config

# one or more directories to manage with vendir
directories:
  - # path is relative to `vendir` CLI working directory
    path: config/_ytt_lib
    contents:
      path: github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-k8s-networking
      helmChart:
        # chart name (required)
        name: stable/redis
        # use specific chart version (string; optional)
        version: '1.2.1'
        # specifies Helm repository to fetch from (optional)
        repository:
          # repository url; supports exprimental oci helm fetch via
          # oci:// scheme (required)
          url: https://...
        # specify helm binary version to use;
        # '3' means binary 'helm3' needs to be on the path (optional)

```
