Renovate supports updating Helm Chart references in vendir.yml via the [vendir](https://carvel.dev/vendir/) tool. Renovate requires the presence of a [vendir lock file](https://carvel.dev/vendir/docs/v0.40.x/vendir-lock-spec/) which is generated by vendir and should be stored in source code.

It supports both https and oci helm chart repositories.
