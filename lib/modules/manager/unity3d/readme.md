Manages version numbers inside the `ProjectVersion.txt` file inside the `ProjectSettings` folder generated by a Unity game engine project. Example: `/home/user/testUnityProject/ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt`.

`ProjectVersion.txt` always have two version references in yml syntax; one with and one without a hash, both are updated:

```yml
m_EditorVersion: 2020.3.15f2
m_EditorVersionWithRevision: 2020.3.15f2 (6cf78cb77498)
```
