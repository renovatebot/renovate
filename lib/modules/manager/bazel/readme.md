Bazel is quite unlike most other "package managers" that Renovate supports, which usually focus on a particular ecosystem like JavaScript, Ruby or Docker.
Instead, Bazel is a build tool so supports a multitude of languages/datasources.
Renovate does not support all possible Bazel references, although would like to, and feature requests are welcome.

If you need to change the versioning format, read the [versioning](../../versioning/index.md) documentation to learn more.
