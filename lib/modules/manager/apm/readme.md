The `apm` manager keeps [APM (Agent Package Manager)](https://github.com/microsoft/apm) dependencies up to date.

Renovate reads the `apm.yml` manifest and updates the git-pinned entries under `dependencies.apm` and `devDependencies.apm`.
Each entry uses the form `[host/]owner/repo[/subpath]#<ref>`, for example:

```yaml
name: your-project
version: 1.0.0
dependencies:
  apm:
    - microsoft/apm-sample-package#v1.0.0
    - gitlab.com/team/project#v2.3.0
devDependencies:
  apm:
    - owner/repo#v1.2.3
```

Only entries that pin an exact `#<ref>` are updated.
Entries without a `#<ref>` are skipped because there is no version to bump.

When an `apm.lock.yaml` lockfile is present, Renovate refreshes it by running `apm install` after updating the manifest.
This requires the `apm` CLI to be available (for example, with `binarySource=global`).
