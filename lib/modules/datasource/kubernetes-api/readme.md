Kubernetes API upgrade versions are manually transcribed from the [Kubernetes API deprecation guide][1].
The Kubernetes API deprecation guide is updated regularly, so this list may be out of date.
This also contains some flux custom resources which where also manually added from [flux releases][2] as well as [external secrets][3] custom resources.
