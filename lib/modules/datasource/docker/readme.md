This datasource identifies an image's source repository according to the [pre-defined annotation keys of the OCI Image Format Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/annotations.md).

This datasource looks for the metadata of the **latest stable** image found on the Docker registry and uses the value of the label `org.opencontainers.image.source` and `org.label-schema.vcs-url` as the `sourceUrl`.

The [Label Schema](https://label-schema.org/) is superseded by OCI annotations, therefore `org.opencontainers.image.source` label should be preferred.

If you maintain a Docker image and want Renovate to find your changelogs, add a `org.opencontainers.image.source` field to your Dockerfile.
The link must point to your GitHub or GitLab repository.
Here's an example from our `renovate/renovate` Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.source="https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate"
```
