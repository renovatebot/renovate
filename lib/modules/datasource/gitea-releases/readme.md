This datasource allows to lookup releases from a [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/) repositories.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! note
    Use [`forgejo-releases`](../forgejo-releases/index.md) as the datasource if you are using [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org).
    Forgejo support will be removed from `gitea-releases` datasource in a future release.

By default it will use `https://gitea.com` to lookup releases.
