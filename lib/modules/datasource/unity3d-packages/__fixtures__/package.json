If the system supports the sensing of user presence, returns true when detected the presence of a user and returns false when detected the absence of a user.\n\n### Changed\n* Changed tracking origin to use Local Floor in place of Floor by default.\n* Changed delta time calculation to utilize OpenXR for frame estimation. Previously internal Unity mechanisms were used. This feature is currently disabled but will be available in the future.\n* When retrieving input feature from [CommonUsages.userPresence](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/XR.CommonUsages-userPresence.html), if XR_EXT_user_presence is supported by the current system, retrieved value will be the same as `OpenXRUtility.IsUserPresent`. If `XR_EXT_user_presence` is not supported, retrieved value will be based on `OpenXRUtility.IsSessionFocused`, which is the default return value before 1.11.0.\n\n### Fixed\n* Fixed Marshal to correctly read the number of bytes for booleans in C++.\n* Fixed crash that occurs while cleaning up destroyed swapchains in OpenXR.\n* Fixed Depth Texture flag disparity between the OpenXR and Oculus providers.\n\n### Added\n* Added `OpenXRUtility.IsSessionFocused` to return if the current session is in the focused state.\n* Added `OpenXRUtility.IsUserPresent` to return the change of user presence, such as when the user has taken off or put on an XR headset. If the system does not support user presence sensing, runtime assumes that the user is always present and IsUserPresent always returns True. If the system supports the sensing of user presence, returns true when detected the presence of a user and returns false when detected the absence of a user.\n\n### Changed\n* When retrieving input feature from [CommonUsages.userPresence](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/XR.CommonUsages-userPresence.html), if XR_EXT_user_presence is supported by the current system, retrieved value will be the same as `OpenXRUtility.IsUserPresent`.
