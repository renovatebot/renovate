[Hermit](https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/) by default looks up packages from the open source project [https://github.com/cashapp/hermit-packages](https://github.com/cashapp/hermit-packages).

Hermit supports [private packages](https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/packaging/private/). To make your private packages works with Renovate, you will need to do the following.

1. perform `hermit search --json` with your private Hermit distribution and save the file to `index.json`
2. make a Github release in your private packages repository named `index` with the asset `index.json` generated in step 1.
3. setup a CI pipeline to repeat step 1 & 2 on new commits to the private packages repository.

Once setup, add a package rule to tell Hermit datasource to fetches packages from in the repository config like the following.

```
"packageRules": [
    {
      "matchManagers": ["hermit"],
      "defaultRegistryUrls": ["https://github.com/your/private-hermit-packages"]
    }
]
```
