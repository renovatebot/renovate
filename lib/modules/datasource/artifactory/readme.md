Artifactory is the recommended registry for Conan packages.

This datasource returns releases from given custom `registryUrl`(s).

The target URL is composed by the `registryUrl` and the `packageName`, which defaults to `depName` when `packageName` is not defined.

The release timestamp is taken from the date in the directory listing, and is assumed to be in UTC time.
