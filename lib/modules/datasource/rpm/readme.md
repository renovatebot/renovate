This datasource `rpm` returns releases of the RPM packages.
It assumes the RPM repository is following the RPM standard and by default it has a repomd.xml in the directory provided by user in the `registryUrl`.
According to this Pulp project doc, https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/2.10/plugins/pulp_rpm/tech-reference/rpm.html,

> repomd.xml is the metadata file that clients use to discover what repository metadata files exist in the repository. It should always be located at repodata/repomd.xml relative to the root of the repository.

## Set URL when using an RPM repository

To use an RPM repository with the datasource, you must set a `registryUrl` with the directory that contains the `repomd.xml` and corresponding `filelists.xml`.

**Example**:

If we have

- `http://example.com/repo/repomd.xml`
- `http://example.com/repo/<SHA256>-filelists.xml` where `<SHA256>` is a dynamically generated SHA256 pattern.

Then the `registryUrl` should set as `http://example.com/repo/` or `http://example.com/repo`.

## Usage Example

Say you're defining dnf/tdnf/yum packages in a `manifest.json` and you want Renovate to update them.

Assuming your `manifest.json` looks like this.

```manifest.json
{
  "package1": "1.0.0-1",
  "package2": "1.1.0"
}
```

where the versioning format could be `<semantic version>-<revision or release>`, or just `<semantic version>`

```renovate.json
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "customManagers": [
    {
      "customType": "regex",
      "fileMatch": [
        "path_to_manifest_json"
      ],
      "matchStringsStrategy": "any",
      "registryUrl": "http://example.com/repo/",
      "datasourceTemplate": "rpm"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: In this example, the `registryUrl` is a static URL. You can also use `registryUrlTemplate` with variables and have it resolved at runtime.

In an RPM repository, the `<SHA256>-filelists.xml` looks like this:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<filelists xmlns="http://linux.duke.edu/metadata/filelists" packages="841">
<package pkgid="<some id>" name="package1" arch="x86_64">
  <version epoch="0" ver="1.0.0" rel="1"/>
  <file>/usr/bin/package1</file>
</package>
<package pkgid="<some id>" name="package1" arch="x86_64">
  <version epoch="0" ver="1.0.0" rel="2"/>
  <file>/usr/bin/package1</file>
</package>
<package pkgid="<some id>" name="package1" arch="x86_64">
  <version epoch="0" ver="1.1.0" rel="1"/>
  <file>/usr/bin/package1</file>
</package>
...
...
</filelists>
```

You can see that `ver` and `rel` (release/revision) is stored separately. But the RPM datasource implementation will combine these together as `ver-rel`. That's why in the `manifest.json` above, the version is defined as `1.0.0-1`, if `rel` is available. Or just `1.1.0` if `rel` is not available.
