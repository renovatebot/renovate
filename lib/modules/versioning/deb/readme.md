Deb versioning compares versions like package managers on Debian-based Linux distributions compare packages (`dpkg`, `apt`).
Deb versioning supports complicated version numbers, including alphabetical characters almost everywhere.
Similar to our "loose" versioning, deb versioning is a "best effort" attempt to convert deb versions to SemVer fields like `major`, `minor`, `patch`.
