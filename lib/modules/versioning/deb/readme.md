"deb" versioning compares versions like package managers on Debian based Linux distributions compare packages (dpkg, apt).
They support rather complicated version numbers (including alphabetical characters almost everywhere).
Just like Renovate's "loose" versioning it tries its best to extract found numbers to fill SemVer known fields like major, minor, patch.
