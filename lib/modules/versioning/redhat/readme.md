Red Hat versioning is used with container images that are maintained by Red Hat.

Red Hat version definitions follow this pattern:

- the version of the main component, where major is required, but minor and patch are optional
- optionally a hyphen followed by release information
- the version of Red Hat's release as an integer, optionally followed by a timestamp like: `1645808164`

Examples of valid Red Hat versions:

- `1`
- `8.5`
- `7.9-628`
- `9.0.0-19.1655192132`

Ranges are not supported by this versioning.
