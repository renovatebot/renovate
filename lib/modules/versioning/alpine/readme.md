Alpine Package Keeper (APK) versioning syntax is used by [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) and [Wolfi/Chainguard OS](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/introducing-wolfi-the-first-linux-un-distro-designed-for-securing-the-software-supply-chain) _packages_ (not the OS version itself).

Typically, an APK version is based off [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org) but with some additional flags/features such as an "epoch" or "revision" (ex: `r1`) which is incremented each time the package maintainer makes a change that differs from the upstream.

For example, the [musl package](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/v3.21/main/x86_64/musl) might have the version `1.2.5-r9`. This means the upstream "tag" of `musl` will be [v1.2.5](https://github.com/kraj/musl/tree/v1.2.5), however the Alpine Linux maintainers have made 9 subsequent additional patches/metadata changes ([in this case](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/commit/efd4d5df7be0ea48d98512671f676fc5ceb14899) most recently to patch CVE-2025-26519).
There are additional features/complexities supported by the versioning scheme such as release candidates (`_rc<num>`), proposed versions (`_p<num>`), and more.
