Ubuntu versioning is used for Ubuntu container images that are referenced by their release version or a codename.

Versions to which this scheme applies are e.g. `22.04` and `jammy`.
Container image tags such as `jammy-20220815` or `focal-20220826` are not compliant with the current implementation.
