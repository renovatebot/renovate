Unity versioning follow semantic versioning, followed by a letter, number and an optional hash:

- Major version is the year of release
- Minor and patch version are incremental, starting at 0
- The letter denotes a stream (**a**lpha, **b**eta, **f**inal release, etc.)
- The number is a growing index
- The hash is calculated by Unity internally and irrelevant for comparision

Examples:

- `2023.2.10f1 (316c1fd686f6)`
- `2023.3.0a17`
- `2023.3.0b4 (2cd31b2a2ee2)`
