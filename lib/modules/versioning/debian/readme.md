Debian versioning is used for Debian container images that are referenced by their major release version or a codename.

Versions to which this scheme applies are e.g. `11` and `bullseye`.
Container image tags such as `11-slim`, `11.4` or `11.4-slim`, `bullseye-20220822` or `bullseye-backports` are not compliant with the current implementation.
