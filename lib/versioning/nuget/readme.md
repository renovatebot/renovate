NuGet versioning matches as closely as possible to the version comparison that NuGet itself uses.

NuGet supports SemVer 2.0.0, but permits versions with differing numbers of version parts.

Ranges are not yet supported by this versioning, but they are defined in NuGet and could be supported in the future.
