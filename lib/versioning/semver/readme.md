Renovate's Semantic Versioning is a strict/independent implementation of [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org). It has been developed to be used in situations where exact-only semver support is needed and not npm's extended semver implementation including ranges.

Ranges are not supported, as per the specification.
