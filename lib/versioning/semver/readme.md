# Semver versioning

## Documentation and URLs

https://semver.org/

## What type of versioning is used?

This is a strict/independent implementation of [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org). It has been developed to be used in situations where exact-only semver support is needed and not npm's extended semver implementation including ranges.

## Are ranges supported? How?

Semver deliberately doesn't support any ranges, as per the spec

## Range Strategy support

Not applicable

## Implementation plan/status

- [x] Exact version support
