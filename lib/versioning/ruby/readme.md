## What type of versioning is used?

> The RubyGems team urges gem developers to follow the Semantic Versioning standard for their gemâ€™s versions.

## Are ranges supported? How?

Range syntax is similar to npm's but not identical. The main difference is the use of "pessimistic" greater than or equals: `~>`

## Range Strategy support

Ruby versioning should support all range strategies - pin, replace, bump, extend.

## Implementation plan/status

- [x] Exact version support
- [x] Range support
