# Nuget

Renovate supports upgrading dependencies in `.csproj` files.

## Version Support

Only SDK-style `.csproj` files are currently supported. By default, this includes:

- .NET Core 1.0 and above
- .NET Standard class libraries
- Any `.csproj` in the SDK-style syntax

To convert your .NET Framework .csproj into an SDK-style project, one can follow the [following guide](https://natemcmaster.com/blog/2017/03/09/vs2015-to-vs2017-upgrade/).

## How It Works

1.  Renovate will search each repository for any files with a `.csproj` extension.
2.  Existing dependencies will be extracted from `<PackageReference>` tags
3.  Renovate will look up the latest version on [nuget.org](https://nuget.org) (or on [alternate feeds](#Alternate%20feeds)) to determine if any upgrades are available
4.  If the source package includes a GitHub URL as its source, and has either a "changelog" file or uses GitHub releases, then Release Notes for each version will be embedded in the generated PR.

## Alternate feeds

Renovate by default performs all lookups on `https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json`, but it also supports alternative nuget feeds. Alternative feeds can be specified in configuration file:

```json
"nuget": {
  "registryUrls": [
    "https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json",
    "http://example1.com/nuget/"
    "http://example2.com/nuget/v3/index.json"
  ]
}
```

If this example we defined 3 nuget feeds. Packages resolving will process feeds consequentially. It means that if package will be resolved in second feed renovate won't look in last one.

## Authenticated feeds

Credentials for authenticated/private feeds can be provided via host rules in the configuration options (file or command line parameter).

```json
"hostRules": [
  {
    "platform": "nuget",
    "endpoint": "http://example1.com/nuget",
    "username": "root",
    "password": "p4$$w0rd"
  }
]
```

Please note that at the moment only Basic HTTP authentication (via username and password) is supported.

## Future work

Contributions and/or feature requests are welcome to support more patterns or additional use cases.
